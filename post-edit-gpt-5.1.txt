Dear John and team,

This note records a temporary change in leadership for Digital Service and the work that will follow from it. The goal is to give the department the reporting, cost control, and management support it needs for December, including the holiday period from mid‑month.

Effective immediately, Digital Service will be led on an interim basis by Liansu for seven days. This period may be extended if we need more time to bed down the changes. During this time, Priyanka will not act as head of department. This is a temporary arrangement. It does not prevent Priyanka returning to a leadership role once we have the reporting and control we need.

Recent weeks have shown that key information about Digital Service work has not always reached directors in time. This includes projects that have stalled, or been put on hold, and safety‑related issues that touch Digital Service work. When this information does not come through, it is harder to move staff, change project order, or deal with risk while there is still room to act. The change in leadership is one of the tools we are using to fix this.

Under Liansu, the department will focus on clearer reporting, full safety reporting, and cost control.

For reporting, Digital Service must give a simple, regular view of project status, including progress, delays, and any suspensions, so that directors are not left assuming that paused work is still moving. Knowledge transfer, staff training, and the real state of each major project should be visible, not inferred. For safety, any incident, near miss, or concern that involves Digital Service work must be reported through the normal safety channels, in full and on time, so that it can be dealt with quickly.

On cost control, Digital Service will take on a clearer role in monitoring spend and results on behalf of the director. This includes helping define and then work within operational spending quotas for purchases and other costs, giving a clear view of how much we are spending to support revenue, and supporting evaluation of staff and contractors against agreed operational measures. The department will also help track a small set of operational metrics so that we can see, early, when delivery or cost is drifting away from plan.

Because Liansu works in a different time zone, the default day‑to‑day contact for Digital Service in Australian working hours will be Iunus. Staff and managers on site should treat Iunus as their first point of contact for Digital Service matters that cannot wait for the next overnight cycle. Mr A will support Liansu directly with the leadership change and the design of the new reporting and cost‑control arrangements, but his hours are aligned with Spain, so local teams should expect less overlap with him during the Australian day.

This change is about making Digital Service work more visible and more effective at a busy time of year. It is not written as a punishment of any individual. The Board and I expect the department to keep improving and to give us the information we need to protect guests, support staff, and keep December trading on track.

Please give full support to Liansu, Iunus, and the Digital Service team during this period. If you have questions, raise them with me through John so that we can keep the answers consistent across the site.

Regards,

[Director’s name]
Director, Rivermill
