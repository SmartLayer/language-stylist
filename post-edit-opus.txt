To: John [Surname], On-site Manager, and the Digital Service and Site Management Team
From: [Director's Name], Director, Rivermill
Subject: Temporary leadership and reporting arrangements for Digital Service

Digital Service will be led by Liansu [Surname] from today for seven days. This period may extend if required for stability, clear reporting, and timely delivery during December. Priyanka [Surname] will not act as head of department during this time. This is temporary and does not preclude Priyanka returning to leadership. Priyanka is one of our hardest working employees. This change strengthens departmental systems and supports long-term effectiveness.

Digital Service is critical to December trading and the holiday sale period beginning 15 December. We must improve transparency and cost control so the Board and I can make timely, informed decisions. Recent months show that essential information about project status, safety matters, and operational issues has not reached directors completely or promptly. This creates real risk that projects appear to progress when they have stalled or changed. It makes reallocating resources, adjusting priorities, and safeguarding people and guests harder.

Under Liansu's leadership, Digital Service will focus on three areas:

First, strengthen reporting so project progress, delays, dependencies, and suspensions are communicated clearly and regularly to management. This includes improving visibility of knowledge transfer, training activities, and true project status.

Second, ensure all safety-related incidents, near misses, or concerns intersecting with Digital Service workstreams are reported promptly and completely through appropriate channels for immediate attention.

Third, design and implement operational metrics, cost controls, and monitoring needed to support the director and Board, including clear spending quotas, purchase controls, and data to evaluate performance and track outcomes.

Liansu operates in a different time zone. Iunus [Surname] will be the default contact for operational matters in Australian time zone. Staff and managers on site should treat Iunus as their primary contact during normal Australian business hours, particularly where prompt decisions or clarifications are required. Mr A [Full Name] will support Liansu directly with leadership transition and designing new reporting and cost-control arrangements. Mr A's working hours align with Spanish time zone, so colleagues should expect most real-time contact in Australian hours through Iunus.

These changes enable Digital Service to succeed during high operational demand and ensure the Board and I can rely on accurate, timely information when making decisions affecting staffing, prioritisation, and investment. They are not punishment. We aim to learn quickly, improve systems, and reinforce culture where early escalation and transparent reporting are normal, especially when projects are at risk or require additional support.

John and the wider management team must give full support to Liansu, Iunus, and Digital Service staff during this transition. Your cooperation is essential to ensuring these reforms take hold smoothly and we enter holiday trading with the clarity and control Rivermill requires.

Raise questions about these arrangements directly with me or, initially, through John for prompt and consistent responses.

Yours sincerely,
