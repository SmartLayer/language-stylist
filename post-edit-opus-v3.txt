To: John [Surname], On-site Manager, and the Digital Service and Site Management Team
From: [Director's Name], Director, Rivermill
Subject: Temporary leadership and reporting arrangements for Digital Service

This note announces a temporary change in Digital Service leadership.

Liansu [Surname] leads Digital Service from today for seven days. This period extends if needed to ensure stability and delivery during December. Priyanka [Surname] steps back temporarily. She may return to leadership later. Priyanka works hard; this change strengthens systems, not diminishes her contributions.

Digital Service is critical to December trading and the 15 December holiday sale. We must improve transparency and cost control so the Board and I can make informed decisions. Key information was under-reported. Projects stalled without director awareness; safety issues went unreported. We missed the window to reprioritise and couldn't stay on top of safety.

Digital Service will focus on three areas under Liansu's leadership.

First, strengthen reporting so project progress, delays, dependencies, and suspensions reach management clearly. This includes visibility of knowledge transfer, training activities, and true project status.

Second, report all safety incidents, near misses, or concerns that intersect with Digital Service workstreams promptly through proper channels.

Third, design and implement operational metrics, cost controls, and monitoring for the department. This includes spending quotas, purchase controls, and data to evaluate performance.

Liansu works in a different time zone. Iunus [Surname] handles day-to-day operational contact in Australian time. Staff and managers at Rivermill treat Iunus as their primary contact during Australian business hours for prompt decisions and clarifications. Mr A [Full Name] supports Liansu directly with leadership transition and new reporting arrangements. Mr A works Spanish hours, so colleagues should expect most real-time Australian contact through Iunus.

These changes let Digital Service succeed during a busy period. The Board and I need accurate, timely information for decisions on staffing, priorities, and investment. This is not punishment. We aim to learn quickly, improve systems, and build a culture where early escalation and transparent reporting are normal, especially when projects need support.

John and the management team must support Liansu, Iunus, and Digital Service staff during this transition. Your cooperation ensures these reforms work and we enter holiday trading with the clarity and control Rivermill requires.

Questions about these arrangements go directly to me or through John for prompt, consistent answers.

Yours sincerely,
