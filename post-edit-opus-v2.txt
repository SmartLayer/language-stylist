To: John [Surname], On-site Manager, and the Digital Service and Site Management Team
From: [Director's Name], Director, Rivermill
Subject: Temporary leadership and reporting arrangements for Digital Service

I am writing to advise you of a temporary change in leadership for the Digital Service department and to outline several related reforms that are necessary to support Rivermill's operations over the coming weeks.

Effective immediately, Digital Service will be led on an interim basis by Liansu [Surname] for an initial period of seven (7) days. This period may be extended if required to ensure stability, clear reporting, and timely delivery of our work during December. During this time, Priyanka [Surname] will not be acting as head of department. This is a temporary arrangement. It does not preclude the possibility of Priyanka returning to the leadership role in the future. Priyanka has been one of the hardest working employees in the business. The intention of this change is to strengthen the department's systems and support its long-term effectiveness, not to diminish her contributions.

Digital Service is critical to our December trading and the holiday sale period commencing around 15 December. We must improve both transparency and cost control so that the Board and I can make timely, well-informed decisions. Key information was under-reported. Projects stalled without director awareness. Safety issues went unreported. We missed the window to reprioritise and couldn't stay on top of safety.

Over the coming days under Liansu's leadership, Digital Service will focus on three areas.

First, strengthening reporting so that project progress, delays, dependencies and any suspensions are clearly and regularly communicated to management. This includes improving the visibility of knowledge transfer, training activities and the true status of each project in the pipeline.

Second, ensuring that all safety-related incidents, near misses or concerns that intersect with Digital Service workstreams are reported promptly and completely through the appropriate channels, so that they can be addressed without delay.

Third, designing and implementing the operational metrics, cost controls and monitoring needed for the department to support the director and Board, including clearer spending quotas, purchase controls, and the data needed to evaluate performance and track operational outcomes.

Given that Liansu is based in a different time zone, the day-to-day default contact for operational matters in the Australian time zone will be Iunus [Surname]. Staff and managers on site at Rivermill should treat Iunus as their primary point of contact during normal Australian business hours, particularly where prompt decisions or clarifications are required. Mr A [Full Name] will be supporting Liansu directly with the leadership transition and the design of the new reporting and cost-control arrangements. However, Mr A's working hours are aligned with the Spanish time zone, so colleagues should expect that most of their real-time contact in Australian hours will be through Iunus.

These changes are being made so that the Digital Service department can succeed in a period of high operational demand and so that the Board and I can rely on accurate, timely information when we make decisions that affect staffing, prioritisation and investment. They should not be interpreted as a punishment of any individual. Our aim is to learn quickly, improve our systems and reinforce a culture where early escalation and transparent reporting are the norm, especially when projects are at risk or require additional support.

I ask John and the wider management team to give full support to Liansu, Iunus and the Digital Service staff during this transition. Your cooperation will be essential to ensuring that these reforms take hold smoothly and that we enter the holiday trading period with the clarity and control that Rivermill requires.

If you have any questions about these arrangements, please raise them directly with me or, in the first instance, through John so that we can address them promptly and consistently.

Yours sincerely,

[Director's Name]
