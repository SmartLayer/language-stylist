# Director’s Writing Style Guide

**Purpose**

This guide enables an assistant or AI to draft text that matches the Director’s writing style: terse but complete, clear on first read, and free of micromanagement.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Terse, not thin.** Remove unnecessary words without dropping information.

2. **Clarity on first read.** If a message needs an end summary, rewrite the message instead.

3. **Show, don’t pad.** Emphasis comes from structure and evidence, not intensifiers.

4. **Autonomy over micromanagement.** Set outcomes and dates; do not prescribe step‑by‑step schedules.

---

## Spelling, Punctuation, and Typography

- **Use British English** spelling throughout (e.g., *colour, centre, programme*).

- **Use the Oxford comma.** “A, B, and C.”

- **Parenthetical information:** use **commas** to bracket non‑essential information, not double em dashes.  
  *Preferred:* “We met the client, the team we briefed last quarter, on Tuesday.”  
  *Avoid:* “We met the client——the team we briefed last quarter——on Tuesday.”

- **Dashes:** acceptable for ranges or breaks in thought; do **not** use double em dashes to insert clauses.

- **Two‑word sentences:** allowed sparingly for emphasis. *Example:* “The distinction matters.”

---

## Sentence Construction (Dependency Grammar)

Write so that dependent words sit close to their heads. The shorter the dependency, the easier the sentence.

- Keep subject and verb close.  
  *Avoid:* “The proposal, after several rounds of optional discussion and commentary, **was** approved.”  
  *Preferred:* “The proposal **was** approved after several rounds of discussion.”

- Place modifiers next to what they modify.  
  *Avoid:* “We will review, with the regional leads, the plan.”  
  *Preferred:* “We will review the plan with the regional leads.”

- Break heavy noun phrases.  
  *Avoid:* “Customer‑growth‑focused onboarding workflow improvements.”  
  *Preferred:* “Improvements to onboarding that support customer growth.”

---

## Emphasis

Prefer structural and semantic emphasis over intensifiers.

- **Use a short sentence.** *“Marketing is important.”*

- **Show relationships.** *“This project depends on marketing.”* / *“Marketing drives growth.”*

- **Avoid intensifiers** such as *very, extremely,* and similar.

However, the director doesn't adopt dramatic structural patterns that make the sentence a lot longer. e.g. the director doesn't use "this isn't... but..." pattern such as "This isn't just a new attraction. It's about fun, creativity and where the hearts and minds connect."

---

## Vocabulary and Jargon

- **Avoid filler words:** *properly, actually, really, truly,* and similar.

- **Avoid overusing “strategy.”** Use it only for genuine, high‑level strategy.  
  *Preferred:* “We need a better strategy for expansion.”  
  *Avoid:* “The best strategy to make tea without spills…” (use *method* or *approach*).

- **Limit “‑ise/‑ize” verb coinages** unless they are standard in the industry or necessary.  
  *Avoid:* *strategise, operationalise, prioritise.*  
  *Prefer:* *set strategy; make operations work; set priorities.*

- **Prefer plain words** over abstractions.  
  *Avoid:* “This change is a strategic alignment with objectives.”  
  *Preferred:* “Shift the team closer to customer service to meet our objectives.”

---

## Directives, Schedules, and Deadlines

- **Set outcomes and dates; do not issue task‑by‑task schedules.**  
  *Preferred:* “Complete the project by 10 October to support the launch on 15 October.”
  *Avoid: "Week 1: do this; Week 2: do that; Week 3..."*

- **Signal without micromanaging.**  
  *Preferred:* “Urgent” / “Please reply today.”  
  *Avoid:* “Reply within two hours.”

---

## Lists and Formatting

- **Blank line before the first list item** to ensure Pandoc renders the list correctly.

- Use lists when the items are parallele or sequential, not using lists to replace paragraphs.

---

## Footnotes

- ## Use **†** and **‡** for footnote markers, not asterisks.
  
  Example: “We will proceed† pending legal review.”
  
  † Legal will confirm the contract terms.  
  ‡ Use for a second note in the same passage if needed.

---

## Email‑Specific Guidance

- Do **not** add an end‑of‑email recap like “In summary, what I meant was…”. Make the email clear; if unclear, rewrite.

- Subject lines should state the action or outcome: *“Deliverable needed: Q4 budget by Friday”*.

- Keep greetings and closings brief and neutral.

---

## Examples (Before → After)

1. **Parenthetical insertion**  
   *Before:* “We met the client——the team we briefed last quarter——on Tuesday.”  
   *After:* “We met the client, the team we briefed last quarter, on Tuesday.”

2. **Avoiding intensifiers**  
   *Before:* “Marketing is very important.”  
   *After:* “Marketing is important.”  
   *Alternative (relational):* “This project depends on marketing.”

3. **Avoiding micromanagement**  
   *Before:* “Week 1 do X, week 2 do Y, week 3 do Z.”  
   *After:* “Deliver the feature by 10 October to support the 15 October release.”

4. **Plain language over jargon**  
   *Before:* “This restructuring is a strategic alignment to organisational objectives.”  
   *After:* “Move the team toward customer service to meet our objectives.”

5. **‑ise/‑ize verbs**  
   *Before:* “We will operationalise the process and prioritise the backlog.”  
   *After:* “Make the process work and set priorities for the backlog.”
