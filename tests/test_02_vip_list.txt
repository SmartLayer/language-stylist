Hi Sarah,

Quick update on tonight's event setup. Marcus mentioned he feels like a VIP now that he got the corner office, but that's beside the point.

For the actual event: if guests are on the VIP list they should enter through the side door and be escorted to the reserved section. See shared drive under "Events/GuestLists/vip_approved.xlsx". Please make sure security has a printed copy by 5pm.

Also, anyone who donated over $10,000 gets VIP treatment even if they're not on the list - use your judgment there.

Thanks,
Jamie
