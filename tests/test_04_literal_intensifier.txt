Dr. Patel,

I'm writing regarding my patient Thomas Reeves (DOB: 03/15/1982) who I'm referring for urgent psychiatric evaluation.

Mr. Reeves presented yesterday after his wife found him researching methods online. He has been drinking heavily since losing his job two months ago - sometimes a full bottle of whisky in an evening. When I asked about his state of mind, his exact words were "I don't see the point anymore." He is suicidal and needs immediate intervention.

His wife mentioned he gave away his guitar collection last week, which he had been building for 20 years. He also cancelled his gym membership and told her "you won't need to worry about me much longer."

Please treat this as critical. I've scheduled him for your earliest available slot but wanted you to have context beforehand.

Thank you,
Dr. Amanda Chen
