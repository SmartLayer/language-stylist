Dear Iunus and Bárbara
When we had the meeting before I head to the Seville airport where I explained how Bárbara can learn from me to do the interviews and later conduct some herself, I was already giving greenlight to start booking in interviews, later I asked for my sleep time to be blocked and 30min / 15min links are made, those I thought were the last blocks, there is no more green lights needed from me to start organising interviews.

The lack of those interviews block us from developing the most needed solutions. We could be focusing on cashflow management when the dire need is something else. That's why most startups fail - they focus on solving the first problem they see suitable for the tech not the first problem they can find paying customers.
