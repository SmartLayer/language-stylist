Hey team,

Just got out of the exec meeting and I need to vent. Did you see the Q4 proposal from marketing? They want to spend $2M on a Super Bowl ad when we haven't even hit product-market fit yet. It's suicidal from a business perspective - we'd burn through half our runway for what, brand awareness? We don't need awareness, we need paying customers.

I tried to push back but you know how Greg gets when his ideas are challenged. He's absolutely convinced this will put us on the map. Meanwhile engineering is begging for three more hires to actually ship the features customers are asking for.

Sometimes I think the whole leadership team has lost their minds. Anyway, wanted to give you a heads up before the all-hands tomorrow when they announce this genius plan.

Coffee later?
